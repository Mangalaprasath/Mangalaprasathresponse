1. We defined functions to load a list of integers from a JSON file, calculate the frequency of each unique number in the list, retrieve the third highest frequency along with the numbers associated with it, and save the output data as JSON.
  
2. The load_data function loads a list of integers from a JSON file specified by the filename passed to it.

3. The calculate_frequency function takes a list of integers as input, counts the frequency of each unique number in the list using the Counter class from the collections module, and sorts the frequencies in descending order. 

4. The get_third_highest_frequency function retrieves the third highest frequency from a list of (number, frequency) tuples generated by `calculate_frequency`. It returns the third highest frequency along with the list of numbers associated with it.

5. In the main function, we execute the sequence of loading data, calculating frequencies, retrieving the third highest frequency, preparing the output data, saving it to a JSON file, and finally printing a confirmation message.
